# SAR-based-Paddy-Rice-Index-SPRI-
Code of computing SAR-based Paddy Rice Index (SPRI) (including R and python versions)

Input data preparation
Three satellite images are required, including:
1.	Sentinel-1 time series covering the rice growth period (named Testdata_VH in sample data), 
2.	Annual NDVImax (named Testdata _NDVImax in sample data) and,
3.	Annual NDWImax (named Testdata _NDWImax in sample data). 
These images are open-source data and can be downloaded from the Google Earth Engine platform. 

Please read the instruction before using the code.
